The API endpoints were listed and documented with Postman, an application that allows interactive API testing. It can be downloaded at https://www.getpostman.com.

Sometimes, uploading large image files on form-data with Postman resulted in "There was an error parsing the body". This is a Postman issue, that is described [here](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/issues/2401#issuecomment-735454025). A solution could be to use similar applications to Postman, like [Insomnia]( https://insomnia.rest/).
